### Hi there, I'm Connor! 👋

- 🛠 Currently, I'm working on a side-project called [Dart Mule](https://beta.dartmule.com/), a dart score keeping app that allows users to... 
  - Invite 🎉 friends, 
  - Create ***private*** games, 
  - Keep score in ***real-time ⏱***, 
  - Track ***wins 🥇*** and ***losses***,
  - and earn ***points*** for victories!

- 🌱 Right now, I'm learning Node, TypeScript, GraphQL, and working on my guitar skills 🤘
